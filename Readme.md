#Petviner

A view into vines of your favorite pets


##Iron Yard Assignment
Create a simple Backbone app that usea all four major components of Backbone (models, collections, views and routers) and that uses an external REST API (e.g. Etsy, Flickr) to fetch collection data and render it in an interesting way

##What I Attempted
I had finally discovered Vine and was getting addicted to taking vines of my new dog, so I attempted to use the unofficial Vine API to render vines. I initially had a more pure API implementation in which I extracted the raw MP4s to render, but those don't render on Firefox and settled for the processing-intensive rendering of numerous iframes, with an attempt to mask some of the overlay text. Ultimately, the assignment was more about trying to create a single-page Backbone app, and I got to have some fun with vines.

##Dependencies
backbone.js
handlebars.js
